# GeonymoooOOOooo
Gonymo is a Web client using Geonym API.


## Purpose
In France, some locations exist without any house number.  
Sometimes, a general address exists not a specific one.  
It can really be difficult to locate an address.

To give an answer to this problem, Geonym was developped.  
Geonym gives a code and a checksum for a specific location.  
This Geonym consists of a 8 letters code and a 1 or 2 letters checksum.
  (ie: PPB2-F4WN/1)

So, Geonym is really more simple to remind and communicate than a gps location.

As a conclusion, what do you want to use?  
. 'PPB2-F4WN/1' Geonym  
OR  
. [ 48.841025 ; 2.377966 ] coordinates?  :-)


## Goal
This Geonym Web client app allows us to:  
. Geocode a French address, get associated coordinates and Geonym, and draw the result on a map.  
. Thanks to coordinates, get associated geonym and draw the result on a map.  
. Thanks to geonym, get associated coordinates and draw the result on a map.
